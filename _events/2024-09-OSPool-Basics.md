<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Sign Up for September OSG User Training!</p>

Sign up for our "OSG Basics" User Training on Tuesday, September 17! Any researcher at a US institution can join this training.  No account is necessary. 

Hosted by the OSG Facilitation team, this training will cover the basics of getting started with research workflows on the OSPool. Topics include: 

* An introduction to OSG services and the OSPool
* Basics of HTCondor job submission
* Hands-on practice submitting HTCondor jobs

If you’re new to the OSPool (or been away for awhile) and want to get started, this is an ideal opportunity to go through core concepts and practice hands-on skills. 

Training is a mix of presentation and hands-on. No prior experience is needed. 

Registration opens one month in advance of the training.

- Tuesday, October 15

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4pm ET on the third Tuesday of the month.
