__[Register Now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeD0PnPEyfn_h-TPlaV4PyqUate9M-fI_ykxBaLCNISo6Kcaw/viewform) for NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Workshop, September 14-15 & 21-22.__

[The 2021 Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC star) Workshop](https://www.thequilt.net/public-event/2021-nsf-virtual-cc-pi-workshop/) builds upon the success of the previous CC* Workshops providing an opportunity for recipients of all active NSF CC* awards to engage with one another, exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts, and collaborate across project areas and project regions. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the 2021 PI workshop will be conducted virtually.  

The  virtual workshop provides flexibility for broader participation of additional CC* award project collaborators such as co-PIs, researchers, and other campus representatives to participate in workshop conversations. Please encourage your project collaborators to register and join us for this meeting.  Feel free to share the registration link with them.     

The PI Workshop will promote dialogue across a range of important and timely topics in campus networking, including the larger context of campus cyberinfrastructure which lends to the development of new ideas, relationships, and collaborations. The workshop breakout sessions will provide the opportunity for program PIs and co-PIs to gain exposure to other cyberinfrastructure technologies or resources. The workshop furthers the development of cross discipline, regional, and national collaborations on cyberinfrastructure to support science research and education applications. By including awardees from all areas of the CC* programs, the workshop facilitates interaction and collaboration between research-intensive and under-resourced colleges and universities, as well as different cyberinfrastructure program areas, in ways that would not otherwise occur.

The sessions cover the following topics:

__Sept 14: Campus CI Plan as a Strategic Vision__  
__Sept 15: Science DMZs and Data Mobility__

__Sept 21: Science Drivers and Research IT and Researcher Engagement__  
__Sept 22: Campus Compute__
