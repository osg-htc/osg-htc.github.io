<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Sign Up for our May 20 user training on high throughput bioinformatics!</p>

Sign Up for our May 20 user training on high throughput bioinformatics!

In this workshop, we will create and scale up a BWA bioinformatics workflow using HTCondor on the OSPool, covering general topics such as software, keeping an organized work environment, and HTCondor submit file options. While the workshop covers a bioinformatics example, topics discussed are applicable to any workflow on the OSPool. This workshop is recommended for users who want to learn how to scale up their computing and create workflows.

Prerequisites: 
* Some familiarity with shell commands, such as how to edit files, copy/paste in the terminal
* Have an OSPool account and know how to log in, submit a single job


**[Register here](https://osgfacilitation.setmore.com/#classes)**

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4:00pm EST on the third Tuesday of the month. It's best to already have an active account on an OSG Connect login node (or other access point that submits to the Open Science Pool) to follow along with hands-on examples, but anyone can listen in by registering.
