* Some familiarity with shell commands, such as how to edit files, copy/paste in the terminal
* Have an OSPool account and know how to log in, submit a single job

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4:00pm EST on the third Tuesday of the month. It's best to already have an active account on an OSG Connect login node (or other access point that submits to the Open Science Pool) to follow along with hands-on examples, but anyone can listen in by registering.
