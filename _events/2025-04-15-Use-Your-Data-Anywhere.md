<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Sign Up for our April 15 user training on the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)!</p>

Sign Up for our April 15 user training on the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)!

In this training, we will introduce attendees to the Open Science Data Federation (OSDF); a data platform that allows you to stage data for both distributed computing (as on the OSPool) and share your data with others. It’s even possible to connect your own storage to the OSDF directly, to both share and use yourself. Join us for an overview of the OSDF and hands-on examples of using it. 

Prerequisites: 
* Some familiarity with shell commands, such as how to edit files, copy/paste in the terminal
* Have an OSPool account and know how to log in, submit a single job


**[Register here](https://osgfacilitation.setmore.com/#classes)**

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4:00pm EST on the third Tuesday of the month. It's best to already have an active account on an OSG Connect login node (or other access point that submits to the Open Science Pool) to follow along with hands-on examples, but anyone can listen in by registering.
