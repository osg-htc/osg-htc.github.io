Office Hours will begin with a very short presentation on "Why is my site not running jobs? Examples, Answers, and Discussion." You'll also have a chance to get your burning questions of the day answered. We will be hosting breakout rooms for troubleshooting and finishing any site configurations. If you have any open tickets you’d like to discuss with OSG staff, we especially encourage you to attend.
