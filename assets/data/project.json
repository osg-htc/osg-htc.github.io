A common therapeutic strategy involves deploying small molecules to inhibit the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the RBD and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to which it binds. But unfortunately, it is difficult to inhibit such PPIs using small molecules due to the large interaction surface area involved. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to develop a novel antiviral strategy whereby small molecules will be used to specifically bind and stabilize intermediates in the RBD folding pathway, thus inhibiting the domain\u2019s folding and promoting the S protein\u2019s degradation. Using folding simulations, we plan to map the RBD\u2019s folding pathway in atomistic detail and identify long-lived intermediates with well-defined binding pockets. We will then identify existing, as well as newly-designed small molecules that bind these cavities with high affinity, but do not bind the native state. The resulting hits will then be experimentally screened for their ability to inhibit RBD folding and their antiviral activity. If successful, this approach will yield a novel therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV 2 that overcomes difficulties associated with most RBD inhibitors.

Such simulations, particularly for Bayesian adaptive clinical trials, can take a tremendous amount of time to run 1,000 or more simulations for a given scenario, and usually hundreds of scenarios are warranted to convince others of the trial\u2019s benefit. Dr. Chapple has used 435 thousand core hours to develop clinical trial designs for testing safety of new agents in pediatric brain tumors, testing multiple COVID-19 therapies simultaneously, and determining optimal treatments based on patient subgroups. Without OSG, it would not have been possible to start enrolling patients in a 3-treatment armed COVID-19 trial at University Medical Center in New Orleans, LA.

Most current vaccine efforts mainly promote B cell production of neutralizing antibodies. While often critical for virus neutralization and disease control, research from the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV epidemic suggests that B cells and serum antibodies involved in the initial immune response are likely to be short-lived. However, many patients with undetectable antibody levels retained immune protection by virtue of long-lived T cells, and correlation of T cell recovery with convalescence in COVID-19 strongly suggests that T cells are critical for virus control. By computationally simulating hundreds of thousands of interactions between T cells and COVID-19-infected cells, we aim to characterize the biochemical features of T cells responsible for long-term COVID-19 immunity and identify a small number of viral molecules that have the highest likelihood of inducing long-term immunity when delivered through vaccines.", "FieldOfScience": "Biological and Biomedical Sciences", "FieldOfScienceID": "26", "ID": "677", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/e9m0sui7r154", "Name": "COVID19_RepertoireTCell", "Organization": "Repertoire Immune Medicines", "PIName": "Michael Noble", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "COVID19_Stanford_Das": {"Department": "Biochemistry", "Description": "RNA tertiary structure of COVID-19 UTRs as therapeutic and vaccine targets: https://daslab.stanford.edu/news", "FieldOfScience": "Biological and Biomedical Sciences", "FieldOfScienceID": "26", "ID": "660", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/keucrg5vtwtm", "Name": "COVID19_Stanford_Das", "Organization": "Stanford University", "PIName": "Rhiju Das", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "COVID19_UCSD_Hsiao": {"Department": "Radiology", "Description": "Develop AI algorithm to diagnose CT scans of pneumonia patients for COVID-19: https://www.kpbs.org/news/2020/apr/07/ucsd-using-ai-identify-pneumonia-coronavirus/", "FieldOfScience": "Radiological Science", "FieldOfScienceID": "51", "ID": "669", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/06wup3aye2t7", "Name": "COVID19_UCSD_Hsiao", "Organization": "University of California, San Diego", "PIName": "Albert Hsiao", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "COVID19_UNL_Weitzel": {"Department": "Computer Science and Engineering", "Description": "Testing of Folding at Home on the Open Science Grid, for COVID-19; https://foldingathome.org/covid19/", "FieldOfScience": "Computer Science", "FieldOfScienceID": "11.07", "ID": "662", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/q9k1b8dfrw25", "Name": "COVID19_UNL_Weitzel", "Organization": "University of Nebraska\\u2013Lincoln", "PIName": "Derek Weitzel", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "COVID19_WeNMR": {"Department": "N/A", "Description": "COVID-19 research through the WeNMR portal, HADDOCK (https://www.eosc-hub.eu/news/haddock-support-covid-19-research)\nWeNMR is a Virtual Research Community supported by EGI.

Foremost among these costs are the twofold cost of males and the cost of destroying successful genetic associations. Understanding the paradox of the persistence of sex despite these detriments is a central question in evolutionary theory. In order to persist regardless of these disadvantages, the benefits of sexual reproduction must be substantial - offspring of sexual reproduction must have at least twice the fitness of asexual clones. The most generalizable hypotheses addressing the benefits of sex propose that genetic drift increases linkage disequilibrium, creating a surfeit of genomes with intermediate fitness. Sexual recombination eliminates linkage disequilibrium, thereby increasing genetic variation for fitness and improving the efficiency of natural selection. However, previous research using this framework has failed to address the biological reality of interactions between genes. Because the cost of destroying beneficial genetic interactions is one of the major costs of sex, this cannot be overlooked. In this work, I use a computational gene network model in which genes interact and genetic interactions evolve to investigate the hypothesis that linkage disequilibrium decreases the fitness and adaptability of asexual populations. I test this both by evolving artificial organisms in conditions that will increase linkage disequilibrium, and by evolving them in an environment with a shifting optimum, which will make linkage disequilibrium more costly. \n\nI am running a python script that runs populations of artificial gene networks (numerical matrices) through repeated rounds (on the order of 10s of thousands) of mutation, selection and reproduction, analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of these populations, and storing the data generated by this in text files.", "FieldOfScience": "Evolutionary Sciences", "FieldOfScienceID": "26.13", "ID": "21", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/nhz3r9d0308l", "Name": "EvoTheory", "Organization": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "PIName": "Christina Burch", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "EvolCE": {"Department": "Biology", "Description": "Multi-locus simulations under periodic environments.", "FieldOfScience": "Biological Sciences", "FieldOfScienceID": "26", "ID": "420", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/nv2rjrft01gg", "Name": "EvolCE", "Organization": "University of Pennsylvania", "PIName": "Davorka Gulisija", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "EvolSims": {"Department": "Biology", "Description": "Evolutionary simulation tracking gene frequencies under a variety of environmental conditions.", "FieldOfScience": "Biological Sciences", "FieldOfScienceID": "26.131", "ID": "166", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/nv2rjrft01gg", "Name": "EvolSims", "Organization": "University of Pennsylvania", "PIName": "Oana Carja", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "EvolvingAI": {"Department": "Computer Science", "Description": "Modern day software and robotics are notorious for lacking robustness and adaptability, often breaking down when encountering unexpected situations.

First, its user-level IP-over-P2P (IPOP) overlay network allows compute and storage resources distributed across independently-administered institutions (including private and public clouds) to be aggregated into a common virtual network, despite the presence of firewalls and network address translators. Second, resources aggregated by the IPOP virtual network run unmodified high-throughput computing middleware (HTCondor) to enable large numbers of model simulations to be executed concurrently across the distributed computing resources. Third, a Web service interface allows end users to submit job requests to the system using client libraries that integrate with the R statistical computing environment.", "FieldOfScience": "Ecological and Environmental Sciences", "FieldOfScienceID": "51.2202", "ID": "574", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/06wup3aye2t7", "Name": "GRAPLEr", "Organization": "Pacific Rim Application and Grid Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA)", "PIName": "Shava Smallen", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "GRASP": {"Department": "Physics", "Description": "Atomic structure calculations  based on multiconfiguration Dirac\u2013Hartree\u2013Fock theory utilizing Grasp2k, a general-purpose relativistic atomic structure package.", "FieldOfScience": "Physics and astronomy", "FieldOfScienceID": "40.1101", "ID": "102", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/f697s61oo78e", "Name": "GRASP", "Organization": "University of Toledo", "PIName": "Richard Irving", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "GRScorrelation": {"Department": "Mathematics", "Description": "We calculate the autocorrelation merit factors for Golay-Shapiro-Rudin-like sequences and the crosscorrelation merit factors for pairs of such sequences.

While everyone starts with a million-dollar idea, only a few manage to transfer into real innovations and impact our lives. What makes those ideas successful? Can you imagine an app that tells you how innovative your idea is? This project will take a computational approach to the understanding of innovation and develop a machinery to learn from real data to evaluate the creativity of new ideas.\nInnovation is a broad topic, constantly discussed in business, economics, sociology, etc. It is such a complex phenomenon that there is no thorough theory about it. Here we will take a combinatorial perspective: an idea is a combination of existing and new knowledge. Hence, the goal is to understand why certain combinations are more interesting than others. Specifically, the first step is to map out our idea space with data from kickstarter, US Patents, and possibly other knowledge databases. The second step is to find interesting patterns, associations and dynamics in this map of knowledge.

In many such circumstances, a process must overcome an energy barrier before proceeding to completion. If the size of the barrier is large compared to the available thermal energy, a process must rely on the occurrence of one or more rare events. For such circumstances, one would like to understand the reaction pathways so as to improve yields, or as in the case of protein folding, to understand the intermediate states. Many simple processes have been explored using theoretical tools such as molecular dynamics, where the movements of individual atoms are calculated. However, when the barrier is large, crossing the relevant barrier is indeed a very rare event. Although computer speeds have been doubling every 18 months (a consequence of Moore's law), the exponentially long waiting times necessary for barrier hopping pushes the required computational effort out of the feasibility range for all but the simplest models.

The main idea is to use three dimensional simulations to constrain the histories of observed galaxies. The majority of work (1) during the initial periods of this startup will be for Graduate Student S. Alireza Mortazavi to shift an existing Condor-based pipeline at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) to the Open Science Grid in order to test and plan for an ambitious expansion of his research program to constrain the dynamical histories of galaxies (Mortazavi et al. 2015). PI Snyder will also begin to develop pipelines to exploit large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (2), which predict the evolution of entire populations of galaxies in representative model universes, requiring data-intensive computing.  \n\n1.  Modeling the Initial Conditions of Interacting Galaxy Pairs Using Identikit\n\nWe use the Identikit software (Barnes & Hibbard 2009, Barnes 2011; http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/research/identikit/ ) to model the dynamics of interacting galaxy pairs. By measuring the initial conditions of galaxy mergers, we can constrain both cosmology and galaxy astrophysics. A galactic encounter has several free parameters and it is time consuming to find the best match between model and data. However, Identikit combines multiple techniques to quickly explore parameter space to find the simulation most similar to the observed shape and constituent velocities. We have developed an automated pipeline based on the latest version of Identikit to scan parameter space and find robust matches and associated uncertainties (Mortazavi et al. 2015), implemented in an STScI-based Condor environment. We will continue to test our method against simulations of galaxy mergers to determine the systematic errors in our measurements. In addition, we will apply it to real data: We have observed a sample of ~30 interacting galaxy pairs using different telescopes. We have reached the limits of the HTCondor cluster at STScI, and therefore we seek to test the options available through XSEDE. We need around 50,000 SUs to compute matches and uncertainties of the measurements for each merging pair (observed or simulated), and so we are requesting a startup allocation of 150,000 SUs to perform tests while planning for a larger research allocation.  This research will have direct applications for interpreting data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV survey \"Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO\" (MaNGA).\n\n2.  Mock data applications from large hydrodynamical simulations\n\nPI Snyder will develop methods for converting large cosmological simulations of galaxy formation (e.g., the Illustris Project www.illustris-project.org) into direct predictions for astronomical observatories.  With XSEDE resources, I will seek to expand our Mock Galaxy Observatory efforts in new and ambitious directions, such as creating synthetic survey fields and advanced spectroscopic data products.  For instance, we will explore the possibility of using large cosmological simulations as benchmarks for the Identikit modeling described in project 1.  For testing, we are requesting 50,000 SUs on Gordon, and Data Oasis storage of 5000GB, enough to store two Illustris Simulation (or similar) outputs plus post-processed data products.

This sample provides a collection of close-packed planetary systems with relatively little spread in the inclination angles of the inferred orbits. A large fraction of the observational sample contains limited multiplicity, begging the question whether there is a true diversity of multi-transiting systems, or if some systems merely possess high mutual inclinations, allowing them to appear as single-transiting systems in a transit-based survey. Planet formation is an active yet poorly understood field: insight to the histories and dynamics of multi-planet systems would be helpful towards understanding planet formation as a whole. \n\nIn previous work, we have determined the regimes of parameter space for which orbital inclinations can be effectively excited by planet-planet interactions among the currently observed bodies. We found that the orbital inclination angles are not spread out appreciably through self-excitation.  In contrast, we found that the two Kepler multi-planet systems with additional non-transiting planets are susceptible to oscillations of their inclination angles, which means their currently observed configurations could be due to planet-planet interactions alone. The multi-planet compact Kepler systems are found to be remarkably stable to oscillations of their inclination angles. The oscillations of inclination found in our previous work inform the recently suggested dichotomy in the sample of solar systems observed by Kepler. However, it would also be useful to study the behaviors of these systems with perturbing companions.

These differences indicate that the shape and strength of the internal magnetic dynamo evolves throughout a stars life. However, because of their great distance we cannot directly observe the surface of other stars to map the locations and sizes of spots. We have developed new software to model the signature of starspots in Kepler data from transiting exoplanet systems. These star-planet systems are unique in having an orbiting planet that passes directly in front of its parent star. When the planet transits the star, it will briefly pass over spots on the star's surface, giving a very small change in the apparent brightness of the system.

These simulations must encompass the entirety of the solar system's history after the formation of the planets, or approximately 4.5 billion years. Additionally, we must conduct these simulations for a suite of potential Planet Nines, further increasing the computational demand.

Preparing for and protecting against these threats makes American communities more resilient to future disasters. To support research in the Civil Engineering community that seeks to address these problems, NEES operates 14 distributed research equipment sites across the United States. The objectives of NEES are to: develop a national and multi-user research infrastructure to enable research and innovation in earthquake and tsunami loss reduction; create an educated workforce in hazard mitigation; and conduct broader outreach and lifelong learning activities. Experimental capabilities at the 14 NEES sites include large-scale shake tables, a tsunami wave basin, large-scale testing facilities, centrifuges, field and mobile facilities, a large-scale displacement facility, and cyberinfrastructure capabilities. NEEScomm, led by Purdue University, connects the 14 NEES research equipment sites and the earthquake engineering community with a powerful information technology infrastructure and a commitment to education, outreach and training related to earthquake engineering. The center facilitates community collaboration and discovery by working to advance research based on experimentation and computational simulations of the performance of buildings, bridges, utility systems, coastal regions, and geomaterials during seismic events. In conjunction with supporting research, NEES seeks to disseminate results through education, outreach, and training to reduce the devastation and loss of human life from earthquakes and tsunamis. Through a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation, the NEEScomm center is charged with leading and managing the operations of this national resource, and enabling collaboration between the 14 NEES research equipment sites and the earthquake engineering community through groundbreaking cyberinfrastructure, education and outreach efforts. NEES provides access to a variety of analysis and simulation tools for the NEES community, which includes OpenSees, OpenFresco, UI-SimCor, RDV, and Data Turbine. A groundbreaking cyberinfrastructure, the NEEShub (http://www.nees.org), connects researchers, practitioners, and the greater civil engineering community with the 14 research labs. NEEShub features the NEES Project Warehouse, which archives data gathered in all NEES experiments, along with a rich set of tools for data management, data viewing, and computational simulation. Most projects include, in addition to physical experimentation, a substantial computational component for comparison with and validation of the physical tests. As part of the Information Technology services provided to the NEES community, NEEScomm is expected to provide production quality cyberinfrastructure that is reliable and relevant to the needs of the NEES community, and to provide facilitated access to and use of campus and/or national computing resources. This proposal seeks to continue and extend the support for computational experiments in the NEES research community.", "FieldOfScience": "Biological and Critical Systems", "FieldOfScienceID": "26", "ID": "44", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/oe09ae0p2pmj", "Name": "TG-BCS110002", "Organization": "Purdue University", "PIName": "Thomas", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 13, "Name": "OSG-XSEDE"}}}, "TG-BIO180012": {"Department": "Computer Science", "Description": "Automatic knowledge base construction and hypothesis generation antibiotic resistance mechanisms for Escherichia coli", "FieldOfScience": "Biological Sciences", "FieldOfScienceID": "26", "ID": "554", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/f62wuiqfjmxm", "Name": "TG-BIO180012", "Organization": "University of California, Davis", "PIName": "Ilias Tagkopoulos", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 13, "Name": "OSG-XSEDE"}}}, "TG-BIO200038": {"Department": "Chemistry", "Description": "RNAMake Science Gateway: a public resource for the design and analysis of RNA 3D structure for custom nanomachines\n", "FieldOfScience": "Biophysics", "FieldOfScienceID": "26.02", "ID": "1202193772", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/q9k1b8dfrw25", "Name": "TG-BIO200038", "Organization": "University of Nebraska\\u2013Lincoln", "PIName": "Joseph Yesselman", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "TG-BIO210118": {"Department": "Molecular and Cellular Biology", "Description": "Prediction accuracy of R-loop formation along the human genome", "FieldOfScience": "Genetics", "FieldOfScienceID": "26.0806", "ID": "834", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/f62wuiqfjmxm", "Name": "TG-BIO210118", "Organization": "University of California, Davis", "PIName": "Gerald Quon", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 13, "Name": "OSG-XSEDE"}}}, "TG-BIO210164": {"Department": "Biology", "Description": "The project aims to build a dataset of bioelectrical dynamics of a simulated cluster of somatic cells.

The central goal of our project is bridging the speed and accuracy gap between these two approaches with machine-learning (ML) potentials. ML potentials have proven their ability to predict energies and other properties of molecules when trained on properly developed data sets. While these potentials are fast and accurate, the majority do not aim to become universal in their description of chemical interactions. This limits their use to only specific molecular systems or bulk materials. Our group developed probably the first universal ML atomistic potentials ANI-1x and ANI-2x for organic molecules containing CHNOSFCl atoms. Apart from other similar efforts in quantum chemistry and materials science, this neural network potential was shown to be transferable across different chemical environments, generalizing to the density-functional theory (DFT) level of accuracy on a large set of organic molecules while being six orders of magnitude faster. \nOne of the main challenges with developing highly accurate and transferable ML potential is the construction of training and test datasets. We developed a fully automated approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials based on active learning (AL) techniques. AL reduces the training set size by up to 90% data required compared to naive random sampling techniques. Even with the AL technique employed, the dataset size required to train accurate and transferable ML potential is in the range of millions of conformers of small molecules (up to about 20 non-hydrogen atoms). We ended up with a dataset size of 5M molecular conformations for CHNO elements (ANI-1x), and an additional 5M data points to parametrize potential for SFCl elements (ANI-2x). \nOur goal in this project is to utilize a High-Throughput Computing (HTC) model to run a very large number of relatively small quantum-chemical calculations in order to build new datasets set for a subsequent training of neural network models. All  calculations  are  orchestrated  as  a  Manager-Worker  application  that  distributes  a  massive  number of tasks to workers using the Python RQ library. We plan to use a single Access Point provided by the HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS) and operated by the Open Science Grid to host the Manager of the application and to deploy the workers across the XSEDE facilities and the OSPool.

The superfluid state of matter is a macroscopic manifestation of quantum mechanics, as it can be described by a single complex wave function with a phase that does not depend on position.  The phase coherence can be probed in a container filled with helium-4, by reducing one or more of its dimensions until they are smaller than the coherence length; the spatial distance over which order propagates.  As this dimensional reduction occurs, enhanced thermal and quantum fluctuations push the transition to the superfluid state to lower temperatures.  However, this trend can be countered via the proximity effect, where a bulk 3D superfluid is coupled to a low (2D) dimensional superfluid via a weak link producing superfluid correlations in the film at temperatures above the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature. Recent experiments probing the coupling between 3D and 2D superfluid helium-4 have uncovered an anomalously large proximity effect, leading to an enhanced superfluid density that cannot be explained using the correlation length alone.We intend to explore the microscopic origin of this enhanced proximity effect via large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of helium-4 in a topologically non-trivial geometry that incorporates the important aspects of the experiments.

The first aptamer to receive FDA approval was pegaptanib (Macugen), which is a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration, a degenerative disease of the macula of the eye that leads to the loss of central vision. The pegaptanib aptamer acts by binding to and inhibiting the action of an isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), arresting degeneration. Functional aptamers are selected from a large, randomized initial library in a process known as SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). This is an iterative process involving numerous rounds of binding, elution, and amplification against a specific target substrate. During each iteration - or round of selection - we enrich for the species with the highest binding affinity to the target. After multiple rounds, we ideally have an enriched aptamer library suitable for subsequent investigation. Modern techniques employ massively parallel sequencing, enabling the generation of large libraries (~10^{6} sequences) in a matter of hours for each round of selection. As RNA is single-stranded, the covariance model (CM) approach (Eddy, SR, Durbin, R (1994). RNA sequence analysis using covariance models. Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 11:2079-88) are ideal for representing motifs in their secondary structures, allowing us to discover patterns within functional aptamer populations following each round.

We propose a mathematical model of cellular aging based on gene interaction network.  This model network is made of only non-aging components, and interactions among genes are inherently stochastic. Death of a cell occurs in the model when an essential gene loses all of its interactions. The key characteristic of aging, the exponential increase of mortality rate over time, can arise from this model network with non-aging components. Hence, cellular aging is an emergent property of this model network. The model predicts that the rate of aging, defined by the Gompertz coefficient, is proportional to the number of active interactions per gene and that stochastic heterogeneity is an important factor in shaping the dynamics of the aging process. Hence, the Gompertz parameter is a proxy of network robustness. Preliminary studies on how aging is influenced by power-law configuration, synthetic lethal interaction, and allelic interactions will be presented. A general framework to study network aging as a quantitative trait will be studied, and the implication on missing heritability will be investigated.

In recent work, we have shown that this is a result of underlying inaccuracies in the energy model itself, due to underlying assumptions that work well for describing amino acids but are inapplicable for describing nucleic acids in solution. We have systematically corrected these biases in order to more accurately capture the inherent flexibility of single-stranded RNA loops, accurate base stacking energetics, and purine anti-syn interconversions.

Such structure contains a variety of topological motifs, such as hairpins, bulges, multi-loops, and notably RNA pseudoknots.  RNA pseudoknots play an important role also in natural RNAs for structural, regulatory and catalytic functions in various biological processes. In particular, it has been recently recognized an interesting interplay between the shape, structure and assembly of icosahedral viral capsids, and the compact RNA packaging topology.  The topology of RNA pseudoknots can be effectively studied by using Random Matrix Theory (RMT), by exploiting a correspondence between a graphical representation of RNA structures with pseudoknots and Feynman diagrams of a particular field theory of large random matrices. The theoretical framework of RMT provides a natural analytic tool for the prediction and classification of pseudoknots, since all Feynman diagrams can be organized in a mathematical series, called topological expansion. The PI is interested in studying numerically some recent matrix models based on RMT to describe the structure of viral RNA encapsidated in a viral icosahedral shell.  The PI has long experience in the application of RMT to the study of RNA pseudoknots with RMT, as well as on the simulation of the geometry and shapes of icosahedral shells.  \nThe simulations the PI intends to perform on XSEDE are Monte Carlo runs of large stochastic matrices, since the matrix model is naturally formulated as zero-dimensional SU(N) field theory  of  Hermitian matrices.  The number of matrices L is equal to number of nucleotides of the RNA molecules, which in viral RNAs can be of the order of L~10^3.  Past preliminary studies showed that the size N of the matrices should be sufficiently large to appreciate topological corrections of the order 1/N^2 and 1/N^4 (at least), which implies the simulation of Hermitian random matrices of order N~24 or N~32. Since the number of degrees of freedom for each matrix is N^2~1024, the configuration space has L*N^2~ 10^6 degrees of freedom.

Current local computational capabilities are sufficient for developing the codes and running toy-model simulations (N~4), but do not satisfy the PI\u2019s needs for research purposes of large realistic systems.

Currently, there are many more known protein sequences than 3D protein structures and experimentally determining their structure can be both expensive and time consuming.

Our group has developed the I-TASSER method, which constructs protein structure models by iteratively assembling structure fragments obtained by multiple threading algorithms. The method was stringently tested in the community-wide CASP experiments and has been widely used by the community, including more than 65,000 registered scientists from 122 countries. Despite its success, a major obstacle in the optimization of I-TASSER involves a dearth of computational resources available for use. We have access to a computing cluster composed of 1,100 cores. However, I-TASSER has seen a surge in users on our web server, and as a result, there have been over 2,000 jobs waiting or running at any one time, far exceeding our current capacity. Therefore, an increase in computational resources for our research interests would greatly benefit the further optimization of the I-TASSER method, as well as the biological and medical community as a whole. Over the course of this allocation, we expect to run approximately 400 I-TASSER jobs; each of these jobs would take 500 CPU hours, thus we would require roughly 200,000 CPU hours total.

The simulation code is written in Python and typically is for a single core. [1] Zaletel, Pollmann; Isometric Tensor Network States in Two Dimensions; Phys. Rev.

However, fulfilling such roles is increasingly dependent on the ability to handle very large spatial datasets and complex analysis and modeling methods based on synthesizing computational and spatial thinking enabled by cyberinfrastructure (CI), which conventional GIS software approaches do not provide. CI-based integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis and modeling, as a holistic solution, is leading to unprecedented capabilities for transforming geospatial sciences.The purpose of this project is to extend and sustain GISolve, a TeraGrid Science Gateway toolkit for GIScience, for establishing a high performance, distributed, and collaborative CyberGIS framework that couples CI, GIS, and geospatial analysis and modeling capabilities. Through the continuous TeraGrid resource allocation support from previous three years, a set of spatial middleware components has been built into the GISolve Toolkit to glue generic cyberinfrastructure capabilities and geospatial analysis methods. This toolkit has been used to build the TeraGrid GIScience Gateway as a collaborative geospatial problem-solving environment for multi-disciplinary researchers to perform large-scale geospatial analysis and modeling, and help non-technical users directly benefit from accessing TeraGrid capabilities. With the support of TeraGrid high-end computing resources, we have developed a set of high-performance parallel and distributed geospatial computational methods for our research projects. Scalability and efficient use of high-end computing resources are the foci in developing these methods. For example, the parallel agent-based modeling and parallel land use optimization code are scalable to thousands of processors on Abe and Ranger with impressive computational performance. The methods so developed have been applied in solving large- and multi-scale geospatial science problems that could not be solved before, such as the study of geospatial pattern of the impact of global climate change on crop yields. With GISolve being widely used in the GIScience community, new methods continue to be identified, proposed, and integrated in the GISolve Toolkit. To support community-contributed applications, we have developed a streamlined application integration process to facilitate cyberinfrastructure-enabled computation and efficient integration into the science gateway for sharing. This project has been growing dramatically with consistent and extended research collaboration and education efforts such as the collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the National Map project and outreach activities with the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science (UCGIS).", "FieldOfScience": "Geographic Information Science", "FieldOfScienceID": "45.0702", "ID": "146", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/10izzs5e7v1r", "Name": "TG-SES090019", "Organization": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "PIName": "Shaowen Wang", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 13, "Name": "OSG-XSEDE"}}}, "TG-STA110011S": {"Department": "NICS", "Description": "renewing project", "FieldOfScience": "Computer Science", "FieldOfScienceID": "30.3001", "ID": "113", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/hp8930spi37u", "Name": "TG-STA110011S", "Organization": "University of Tennessee, Knoxville", "PIName": "Stephen McNally", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 13, "Name": "OSG-XSEDE"}}}, "TG-STA110014S": {"Department": "San Diego Supercomputer Center", "Description": "Staff Account for Training", "FieldOfScience": "Training", "FieldOfScienceID": "30.3001", "ID": "48", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/06wup3aye2t7", "Name": "TG-STA110014S", "Organization": "University of California, San Diego", "PIName": "Nancy Wilkins-Diehr", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 13, "Name": "OSG-XSEDE"}}}, "TG-TRA090005": {"Department": "Advanced Research Computing - Technology Services", "Description": "Campus Champion Allocation for University of Michigan", "FieldOfScience": "Training", "FieldOfScienceID": "30.3001", "ID": "1739496113", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/4ocf9kvq30fn", "Name": "TG-TRA090005", "Organization": "University of Michigan", "PIName": "Michelle Johnson", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "TG-TRA100004": {"Department": "ITS", "Description": "Swarthmore College Campus Champion Renewal", "FieldOfScience": "Training", "FieldOfScienceID": "30.3001", "ID": "45", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/a9u068qpwh85", "Name": "TG-TRA100004", "Organization": "Swarthmore College", "PIName": "Andrew Ruether", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 13, "Name": "OSG-XSEDE"}}}, "TG-TRA110013": {"Department": "ITS", "Description": "Description: Campus Champions for Case Western Reserve University, helping faculty to start onboarding XSEDE resources.

AQP focuses on deriving fast and accurate estimations for complex queries that are usually time-consuming and expensive to run on large datasets. Traditional methods, such as histogram and sketch, are insufficient when applied to big data because of the processing limits. An essential question lacking research is how to assess the errors of AQP estimations.\nThis project focuses on assessing the errors of AQP query estimations, especially for common selection queries. Traditional methods can generate confidence intervals for query estimations based on strict assumptions such as the normal distribution assumption. Therefore, they are not applicable to massive datasets. In this project, the PI will employ a novel non-parametric statistical method called bootstrap sampling which requires less strict assumptions and brings many statistical advantages.\nA prototype system will be developed employing bootstrap sampling to efficiently compute standard errors and confidence intervals for AQP systems, especially those answering selection queries, namely \u03c3-AQP. Selection queries comprise a large portion of daily data queries. For broader applications, this framework will allow selection queries to include common aggregation operators such as average, sum, and count. The PI will investigate the computing and storage costs when bootstrap replicas are computed. A framework will be developed to automate both the AQP estimation and error estimation operations.

Cells are stained with fluorescent dyes that mark\nseveral constituents, producing images from which hundreds of distinct\nmeasurements can be extracted at the single cell level. We will carry out\nproof-of-principle computational experiments using morphological profiling in\ndiverse and significant applications, such as connecting unannotated genes to\nknown pathways, identifying signatures of disease, predicting a small molecule\u2019s\nmechanism of action, enriching chemical libraries for diverse bioactivity, and\nidentifying new compounds or materials with desired phenotypic effects. Despite\nour successes in this field so far, the methods development for morphological\nprofiling is a wild frontier: novel methods are used but not compared,\nintegration with other data types (such as transcriptomics) has not !\nbeen explored, and deep learning is not yet leveraged to its potential.

Ultimately, we aim to develop best practices for the field and create\nthe foundation for user-friendly, open-source tools to discover and quantify\nrelationships among genetic or chemical perturbations and disease state, across\na diverse array of biological areas of study and disease areas.", "FieldOfScience": "Molecular and Structural Biosciences", "FieldOfScienceID": "26", "ID": "510", "InstitutionID": "https://osg-htc.org/iid/e9m0sui7r154", "Name": "cellpainting", "Organization": "Broad Institute", "PIName": "Shantanu Singh", "ResourceAllocations": null, "Sponsor": {"CampusGrid": {"ID": 14, "Name": "OSG Connect"}}}, "cgdna": {"Department": "Institute of Molecular Engineering", "Description": "Molecular-level information of DNA at nanometer length scales is of fundamental interest to many aspects of nanotechnology and biology.

Models describing the characteristic patterns of missing data and genotyping error in real microsatellite data sets were developed, and used to modify the simulated data sets.  Performance of an ordination, a tree based, and a model based Bayesian method of population structure inference was evaluated before and after data set modifications.  The ability to recover correct population clusters decreased as missing data increased.  The rate of decrease was similar among analytical procedures, thus no single analytical approach was preferable when\n faced with incomplete data.  Researchers should expect to retrieve 3\u20134% fewer correct clusters for every 1% of a data matrix made up of missing data using these methods.  For every 1% of a matrix that contained erroneous genotypes, approximately 1\u20132% fewer correct clusters were recovered using ordination and tree based methods.  A Bayesian procedure that minimizes the deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in order to assign individuals to clusters performed better as genotyping error increased.

Detecting community response to climate change is an important issue with regards to how species have and will react to past and future events. Furthermore, whether species responded individualistically or in concert is at the center of related questions about the abiotic and biotic determinants of community assembly. This method combines multi-taxon genetic datasets into a single analysis to determine the proportion of a contemporary community that historically expanded in a temporally clustered pulse as well as when the pulse occurred. We will apply this method to 59 species in the Hawaiian Archip ela! go in order to examine community response of coral reef taxa to sea-level change in Hawaii. The method can accommodate dataset heterogeneity such as variability in effective population size, mutation rates, and sample sizes across species and utilizes borrowing strength from the simultaneous analysis of multiple species.
