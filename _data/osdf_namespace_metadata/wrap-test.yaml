  Scientific progress relies on collaborative access to data, instruments, and computing across institutions. However, wireless infrastructure at research institutions often presents a tradeoff: researchers require flexibility to experiment, while campus IT teams must enforce strict security and compliance policies. This misalignment can slow innovation and introduce vulnerabilities. The Wireless Research Access Programmable (WRAP) project addresses this by creating a programmable wireless architecture that allows researchers to manage domain specific policies while providing IT teams with lightweight, formally verifiable mechanisms to ensure compliance. WRAP enables secure, cross campus collaboration in fields such as quantum computing and neuroscience, integrating seamlessly with existing infrastructure. Developed with domain researchers, it ensures alignment with scientific workflows and advances scalable, policy compliant wireless systems for national cyberinfrastructure.
