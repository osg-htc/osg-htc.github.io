Campus Cyberinfrastructure Award Recipients Power the Open Science Pool
=======================================================================

The OSG consortium operates the Open Science Pool (OSPool). The OSPool is founded on the principle of sharing, and any researcher at a US institution can access it. The capacity that powers this national computing resources is contributed by clusters located at academic and research institutions. [Campus Cyberinfrastructure awardees](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748) play an important role in the value that the OSPool brings to the national S&E community. By sharing their resources, Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) award recipients provide tremendous support for open research.

<h2>349 Million Core Hours Contributed by CC* Campuses</h2>

In the last year, nineteen campuses contributed over [349 million core hours to researchers using distributed high throughput computing (dHTC).](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/) (August 2020 - July 2021) These core hours supported over 236 projects in fields of study ranging from the medical sciences to the evolutionary sciences, and from biostatistics to physics. This campus support throughout the United States contributed to the advancement of science and to researchers both on and off their campuses. The campuses currently contributing CC*-funded resources are shown in the map below. Every month, the OSG is working to help additional campuses to join this effort to support open science by sharing their resources:

Projects supported by these contributions include (among many others):

- multiple COVID-19 research projects
- virtual screening for pain relief compounds
- light production in heavy-ion collisions 
- genomic analyses to understand the evolutionary process of marine invasion
- computer network optimization for large-scale scientific workflows


The CC* Program
---------------


The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports the Open Science Pool and campuses that contribute resources to it. For 2021 the National Science Foundation funds the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748" target="_blank"> Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program (NSF 21-528).</a>
This program invests in coordinated campus-level networking and cyberinfrastructure improvements, innovation, integration, and engineering for science applications and distributed research projects. Learning and workforce development (LWD) in cyberinfrastructure is explicitly addressed in the program. Science-driven requirements are the primary motivation for any proposed activity.

**Upcoming Deadline: October 11, 2021** 

The NSF supports awards in 5 program areas:
>- 	Data-Driven Networking Infrastructure for the Campus and Researcher awards will be supported at up to $500,000 total for up to 2 years
>- 	Regional Connectivity for Small Institutions of Higher Education awards will be supported at up to $1,000,000 total for up to 2 years
>- 	Network Integration and Applied Innovation awards will be supported at up to $1,000,000 total for up to 2 years 
>- 	Campus Computing and the Computing Continuum awards will be supported at up to $400,000 total for up to 2 years
>- 	Planning Grants and CI-Research Alignment awards will be supported for up to $200,000 total for up to two years

<h2>OSG Can Help with Your CC* Proposal</h2>

The OSG, funded partly through the <a href="https://path-cc.io/" target="_blank"> Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh)</a>, has significant experience working with CC* applicants and awardees, offering letters of support and consulting for:

>- bringing the power of the OSG to your researchers
>- gathering science drivers and planning local computing resources or
>- CC*-required resource sharing for the Campus Compute category, and other options for integrating with OSG

In the most recent call for proposals <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748" target="_blank">(NSF 21-528)</a>, joining the OSG is mentioned as a potential path to sharing resources with the wider research community:

> Proposals are required to commit to a minimum of 20% shared time on the cluster and describe their
> approach to making the cluster available as a shared resource external to the campus, [...] One
> possible approach to implementing such a federated distributed computing solution is joining a multi-campus
> or national federated system such as the Open Science Pool.

The OSG team actively works with campuses to integrate them smoothly into the OSG. We have an experienced and friendly team of engineers and facilitators dedicated to supporting campus computational groups and ensuring a positive onboarding with the flexibility to meet your configuration needs. To get started please email [OSG Support](mailto:support@osgconnect.net).

<h2>Contributing to the Open Science Pool</h2>

Many other campuses and other sites, in addition to CC* awardees, contribute resources to the Open Science Pool. <a href="https://map.opensciencegrid.org/map/iframe?view=EduvsOther#29.22889,-90.08789|4|terrain" target="_blank">View them here.</a> CC* awardees are a subset of the overall contributions by educational institutions. In fact, many campuses have used their Open Science Pool contributions to aid in the success of a subsequent CC* award application to NSF. 

<h2>The Open Science Pool is Open to You!</h2>
The Open Science Pool is an <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/" target="_blank">HTCondor pool</a> that OSG users access via 'access points' operated by the OSG or by campuses supporting 'local' access to OSG. Any researcher at a US academic, government, or non-profit institution can use the Open Science Pool via OSG-operated access points to harness the capacity of the Open Science Pool by visiting <a href="https://www.osgconnect.net/" target="_blank">OSG Connect and getting an OSG Account</a>. (It's free!) The researcher does not have to belong to a collaboration (big or small) nor to any particular campus (big or small).
