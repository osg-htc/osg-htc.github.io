OSG Support for COVID-19 Research
=================================

Please contact us at <mailto:help@osg-htc.org> if your research group could benefit
from computing resources or consulting related to COVID-19, or if you would like to support COVID-19
research by sharing your own capacity.

OSG is helping to organize extra resources to be made available to COVID-19 research!  These resources include:

- **Capabilities for a variety of computational research tasks.** See [Computation on the OSPool](/services/ospool/).
- **Proactive consultation and facilitation** for quickly scaling up and automating workloads with up to thousands of 
concurrently-running jobs.
- **Access to significant computing capacity** through the *[OSG Connect](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home)*
  service, which provides a batch system submit environment based on HTCondor (allowing up to millions of jobs submitted via a
  simple submit file).  The OSG aggregates
  more than 100 clusters across the US, and COVID-19 projects have concurrently accessed tens of thousands of cores
  through this mechanism.
- **Expertise** for maximizing research throughput, including help with workflow design and development.

COVID-19 researchers can access OSG through the Open Science Pool (e.g., the "`osg` VO"), whether
via the [OSG Connect service](https://connect.osg-htc.org/), or by coordinating 
with us to route work from other submission points.

Sites Supporting COVID-19 Research
----------------------------------
Any computing resource provider supporting the `osg` VO ("Open Science Pool", see above) is likely already providing hours
to support COVID-19.  If you would like to provide additional resources _exclusive_ for COVID-19,
[instructions are available](/docs/compute-element/covid-19/).

Other Activities
----------------

-   OSG participates in the COVID-19 HPC consortium,
    a broad consortium of industry, academia, and national labs to make a diverse set of
    computing resources available for research.  The COVID-19 HPC consortium meets daily
    to review requests from researchers.
    
-   Science Responds is a broad COVID-19 response effort from
    the scientific community.

-   The IRIS-HEP software institute provides effort to the OSG through its _OSG-LHC_ area; it
    has been coordinating additional [COVID-19 activities](https://iris-hep.org/covid-19).
    
-   OSG is participating in the
    [WLCG COVID-19 task force](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/WLCGresourcesForCOVID-19research)
    (and broadly with computing organizations in Europe) to make LHC resources available to
    COVID-19 research.

-   OSG and EGI are joining forces to commit specialized technical support, specialized
    simulation tools, and compute and storage resources, to accelerate progress on
    [COVID-19 research](https://www.egi.eu/egi-call-for-covid-19-research-projects/).

-   OSG supports the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute](https://molssi.org) (MolSSI), which is
    coordinating and has built the
    [COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub](https://covid.molssi.org).
