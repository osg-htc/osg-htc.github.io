<h2>Upcoming Training Events</h2>

All User Training sessions are offered on Tuesdays from 2:30-4pm ET 
(11:30am - 1pm PT), on the third Tuesday of the month. The trainings are 
designed as stand alone subjects. You do not need to bring/have your dataset 
prepared before the training. The only prerequisites are some familiarities 
with using the command line inteface or shell. Having some familiarities with 
HTCondor job submissions are useful but not required.
