The OSG Consortium uses Google Groups to implement mailing lists that end in ```@osg-htc.org```.
This page explains how to manage your membership in these lists.

If you have any issues with our mailing lists or this document,
please contact us at [support@osg-htc.org](mailto:support@osg-htc.org).

## Joining a Mailing List

**Some mailing lists are restricted and need approval from a staff member to join.
If you have issues joining a list, email [support@osg-htc.org](mailto:support@osg-htc.org)**

First, pick one of your email addresses to add to our mailing list.
-   If the email address is associated with a Google account then use the [website to join](#joining-via-the-website).
-   If the email address is **not** associated with a Google account then [join via an email](#joining-via-an-email).
