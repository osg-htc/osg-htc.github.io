# Learning Opportunities with the OSG Consortium

<img src="/assets/images/osg-school-hands.jpeg" class="w-100" /> 

## Learn how to use the OSPool and OSDF

The OSG Facilitation Team supports researchers across the United States who want 
to run large computing workloads on HTC capacity like the [OSPool](/services/ospool). 
The team runs monthly training events and the materials from these trainings are publicly available. 

* [Upcoming Training Opportunties](/services/facilitation/monthly-training) (also listed on the [Events Page](https://osg-htc.org/events.html))
* [Past Training Materials](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/support_and_training/training/materials/)

Anyone can register and join monthly trainings - no account is needed!

## Bring us to your campus or event!

Are you hosting a conference or event around computing? Do you want to bring 
training to your researchers on campus? The Facilitation Team can do guest 
presentations or trainings at events of any scale - campus, regional or national. 
Just contact us to start a conversation about what's possible. 

## Go deeper with the HTC community

Our community also hosts two major annual events to draw together members of 
the broader HTC community.
