# OSG Outreach Area

The goal of the Open Science Grid (OSG) Outreach area is to inform people about Distributed High Throughput Computing
(DHTC) and other topics related to the OSG mission.

## OSG User School

The OSG runs the OSG User School, an annual education event for researchers who want to learn to use DHTC methods and
tools.  It is held each summer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
