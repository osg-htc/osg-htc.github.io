Sign Up for our Feb 18 user training on building containers!

Getting your computational program to run on someone else's computer can be a difficult process, especially on the OSPool, where there are many different operating systems and an inconsistent variety of programs (and versions) installed. But what if there was a way to make sure your job always ran using the operating system, programs, and versions that you chose? In this training, we'll show you how you can achieve that very thing through the use of "container" technology. We'll guide you through how to build your own container with the programs you want and how to use it in your OSPool jobs.

Prerequisites: 
* Some familiarity with shell commands, such as how to edit files, copy/paste in the terminal
* Have an OSPool account and know how to log in, submit a single job
* [Optional] Know how to install your desired programs


**[Register here](https://osgfacilitation.setmore.com/#classes)**

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4:00pm EST on the third Tuesday of the month. It's best to already have an active account on an OSG Connect login node (or other access point that submits to the Open Science Pool) to follow along with hands-on examples, but anyone can listen in by registering.
