Connor Natzke, a PhD student at the Colorado School of Mines, was this year’s recipient of the OSG David Swanson Memorial Award. The memorial was established 
to honor our late colleage David Swanson who contributed to campus research across the country. Natzke is currently located at TRIUMF, a particle physics 
laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he uses OSG services to investigate the strong nuclear force. Natzke attended OSG User School in 2019 and 
the OSG All-Hands Meeting in 2021, and at both of these events he learned valuable ways to improve his workflow. At the All-Hands Meeting 2022, Natzke 
spoke about his journey with the OSG Consortium and the impact OSG services have had on his research to date –– including a forty-fold increase in the 
simulation speed of his project. Watch his presentation below.
