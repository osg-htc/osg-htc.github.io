        Established in 2005, the OSG Consortium operates a fabric of distributed High
        Throughput Computing (dHTC) services in support of the National Science & Engineering
        community. The research collaborations, campuses, national laboratories, and software
        providers that form the consortium are unified in their commitment to advance
        open science via these services.

      <p>
        Any researcher performing Open Science in the US can become an OSPool user. The OSPool
        provides its users with fair-share access (no allocation needed!) to processing and
        storage capacity contributed by university campuses, government-supported
        supercomputing facilities and research collaborations. Using state-of-the-art
        distributed computing technologies the OSPool is designed to support High
        Throughput workloads that consist of large ensembles of independent computations.

        presentations from researchers who reviewed their use of OSG services, executives who
        discussed the current state and future plans for the OSG services, and administrators

          <hr>
          <p>The OSG facilitates access to distributed high throughput computing for research in the US.
            The resources accessible through the OSG are contributed by the community, organized by the OSG, and governed by the OSG consortium.
            In the last 12 months, we have provided more than 1.2 billion CPU hours to researchers across a wide variety of projects.

            past year were opportunistic, contributed by university campuses, government-supported supercomputing facilities and research collaborations.
