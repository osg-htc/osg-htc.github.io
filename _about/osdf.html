<div  class="p-2 bg-light">
    <p>
        The Open Science Data Federation (OSDF) is an OSG service that enables users and institutions to
        make datasets available to distributed high-throughput computing (dHTC) environments such as the
        <a href="/about/open_science_pool">Open Science Pool</a> (OSPool). The OSDF provides execution points with remote
        access to data via a global namespace and a set of <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/#architecture"><em>data caches</em></a> which can access data stored in
        <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/#architecture"><em>data origins</em></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        By providing the distributed data access layer via the caches, jobs running in the OSPool (or any
        other resource pool) can reduce wide-area network consumption, load on the data origins, and latency
        of data access.
    </p>

    <p>
        Any US-based academic, government, or non-profit institution may operate a data origin to export their
        users’ data.  Researchers with an OSG Connect account may also use the origin at the <a href="https://connect.osg-htc.org">OSG Connect</a>
        access point.
    </p>

    <p>
        To learn how to access your data through the OSDF, please reach out to our team of Research Computing Facilitators
        through <a href="mailto:support@opensciencegrid.org">support@opensciencegrid.org</a>.

<h3 id="who-can-access-my-data">Who can access my data?</h3>

<div  class="p-2 bg-light">
    <p>
        Access control for the OSDF is managed by each <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/#architecture"><em>origin</em></a> service.  The origin can be configured to make data public
        or private, and can control the rules for sharing.  For example, the OSG Connect service allows users to
        make their data accessible to all (public) or only accessible to their own jobs.
    </p>

    <p>
        The data may additionally be visible to the administrators of the <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/#architecture"><em>cache</em></a> services, and the execution point where
        the job runs.  Non-public data is encrypted when sent over the network but not on disk.

<div  class="p-2 bg-light">
    <p>
        The origins on the OSDF are generally managed by the projects or institutions which own the underlying storage. Additionally the 
        <a href="https://path-cc.io/">PATh project</a> (which funds many core OSG technologies and services) offers options for 
        PATh-hosted origins otherwise owned by and configured specifically for relevant organizations, as described
        <a href="{{ '/about/osdf/deploying_an_osdf_origin.html' | relative_url }}">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The caches are largely managed by OSG staff, who remotely operate the services.  Some caches are dedicated to a specific
        experiment; a number of caches are specific to the <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a> experiment. The cache 
        hardware is distributed throughout the US, including points of presence in the <a href="https://internet2.edu/">Internet2</a>
        and <a href="https://www.es.net/">ESNet</a> networks and universities facilities such as UW-Madison,
        Chicago, Syracuse, UCSD, and Nebraska.
