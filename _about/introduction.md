### What we do

The OSG provides common service and support for resource providers and scientific institutions using a distributed fabric of high throughput computational services. The OSG does not own resources but provides software and services to users and resource providers alike to enable the opportunistic usage and sharing of resources. The OSG is jointly funded by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. [here](/assets/pdf/OSG_Calling_Card_110515.pdf) for a two-page printable overview of OSG.

The Open Science Grid (OSG) supports science such as:

- High Energy Physics
- Structural Biology
- Community VO (multiple sciences): OSG Connect

The OSG is primarily used as a high-throughput grid where scientific problems are solved by breaking them down into a very large number of individual jobs that can run independently. The most successful opportunistic applications run on the OSG share the following characteristics:

- The application is a Linux application for the x86 or x86_64 architecture.
- The application is single- or multi-threaded but does not require message passing.
- The application has a small runtime between 1 and 24 hours.
- The application can handle being unexpectedly killed and restarted.
- The application is built from software that does not require contact to licensing servers.
- The scientific problem can be described as a workflow consisting of jobs of such kind.
- The scientific problem requires running a very large number of small jobs rather than a few large jobs.
